# NAVEDEX

## Description

Navedex Challenge:
Create an application for viewing and creating "navers" containing information such as name, age, position, employment duration, and projects participated in.
The screens used as a guide are available in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/MIh7DeADz8M3mmcQwpcFdD/Teste-Mobile?node-id=1253%3A0).
The application integrates with the Navedex API developed by nave.rs, available at the URI: https://navedex-api.herokuapp.com/v1/. The API documentation is available in [collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/e6afe4028c2a1e56e577), and you need to use Postman to import it.
